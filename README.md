Reducing Readmissions – Hospital Data Analytics Case Study

Project Overview
Hospital readmissions within 30 days are a major concern for healthcare organizations as they increase costs, strain hospital resources, and may indicate gaps in quality of care.
In this project, I worked as a Data Analyst in a hospital administration setting (Novartis case scenario) to analyze hospital admission data and identify patterns and factors associated
with high readmission rates. The ultimate goal was to generate data-driven insights that can help stakeholders reduce unnecessary readmissions and improve patient outcomes.
This entire project was completed using Microsoft Excel, focusing on strong analytical thinking, data cleaning, pivot-based analysis, and business interpretation.

Problem Statement
The hospital observed a rise in patient readmission rates, leading to:
Increased healthcare costs
Poor patient experience and outcomes
Risk to hospital reputation and regulatory compliance
The challenge was to identify key drivers of readmissions and provide actionable insights that support better clinical and administrative decision-making.

Stakeholders
This analysis is designed to support multiple hospital stakeholders:
Internal Stakeholders
Hospital Board & Trustees – strategic oversight and cost control
C‑Suite Executives – operations, compliance, and performance metrics
Department Heads – staffing, workflow, and resource planning
Physicians & Nurses – improving quality of care and treatment outcomes
Administrative Staff – scheduling, records, and coordination
External Stakeholders
Patients & Caregivers – improved health outcomes
Insurance Providers – cost efficiency
Government & Regulators – quality and compliance standards

Dataset Information
Source: Kaggle – Hospital Administration Data
Records: Patient encounters with demographic, clinical, and utilization details
Target Variable: readmitted
1 → Readmitted within 30 days
0 → Not readmitted

Key Features
Patient demographics: age, race, gender
Hospital stay details: time_in_hospital, medical_specialty
Clinical activity: lab procedures, medications, diagnoses
Prior utilization: outpatient, emergency, inpatient visits
Diabetes-related indicators and medication changes
Note: Weight data contains significant missing values and was treated cautiously during analysis.
Community – access to reliable healthcare services

Tools Used
Microsoft Excel only
Data cleaning & filtering
Pivot tables & pivot charts
Conditional formatting
Correlation analysis
Descriptive statistics

Analysis Performed
Basic-Level Analysis
Readmission rate distribution by age group
Average length of stay by medical specialty
Impact of emergency visits on readmissions
Readmission rates among diabetic patients
Effect of medication changes on readmissions
Lab procedures vs readmission trends
Readmission variation by race and gender
Medication count vs length of stay

Medium-Level Analysis
Impact of multiple diagnoses (comorbidities)
Prior hospital utilization patterns
Demographic differences in treatments
Specialty-based prescribing patterns

Advanced Thinking (Conceptual)
High-risk patient identification logic
Patient segmentation ideas based on utilization
Financial impact perspective of readmissions
Ethical and privacy considerations in healthcare analytics

Key Insights
Elderly patients (70+ age groups) showed higher readmission rates
Patients with frequent emergency visits had a strong association with readmissions
Longer hospital stays were often linked with complex diagnoses and multiple medications
Diabetic patients with medication changes had higher readmission probability
Certain medical specialties consistently showed longer average stays

These insights highlight opportunities for:
Better discharge planning
Targeted post‑discharge follow‑ups
Improved chronic disease management programs

Business Impact
Supports hospital leadership in reducing avoidable readmissions
Helps optimize resource allocation and staffing
Improves patient care quality and satisfaction
Encourages preventive and data-driven healthcare strategies

Ethical Considerations
Patient privacy and data confidentiality were respected
Analysis focused on trends, not individual profiling
Insights intended for quality improvement, not discrimination

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how Excel-based analytics,when combined with strong domain
understanding, can deliver meaningful insights in healthcare. The analysis provides a foundation for
hospitals to design targeted interventions, improve patient outcomes, and reduce unnecessary readmissions.
