This repository contains three comprehensive projects demonstrating practical skills in Excel, healthcare data analysis, and food delivery analytics. 
Project 1: Excel Practical Assignment includes hands-on tasks on arithmetic functions, data cleaning, formatting, sorting, logical functions, Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP/HLOOKUP, macros,
and VBA using the Sample Superstore Sales dataset, aimed at building strong Excel expertise. Project 2: Hospital Patient Data Analysis focuses on analyzing patient encounter data
to explore demographics, procedures, medications, and diagnoses to understand readmission patterns, using data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory analysis, and 
visualization to generate actionable insights and prepare the dataset for predictive modeling. Project 3: Porter Dataset – Food Delivery Analysis examines delivery operations,
store performance, order metrics, and workforce utilization, including data preparation, calculating key metrics like delivery durations and average order values, and visualizing 
trends to optimize operations, with the full dataset hosted externally
